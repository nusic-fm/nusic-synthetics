# ðŸ”Š NUSIC Synthetics

ðŸ‘· WORK IN PROGRESS ðŸ‘·

## Introduction

Synthetic music assets are conceived to bootstrap liquidity for the music industry; artists and labels require capital to operate and could benefit from access to Decentralized Finance. Though real world assets are starting to enter DeFi, education is required in order to enable originators to tokenize thier assets. In order to accelerate this educational process we present NUSIC, a protocol which enables the creation of synthetic assets that track the real-world popularity of music.

By offering anyone the opportunity to particiapte in the collatoralization and trade of synthetic music assets, we may create an inclusive marketplace with cultural relevance that attracts and incentivizes a broad audience. Once a synthetic music asset marketplace has reached a sufficient level of TVL this will be attractive for real-world artists and labels to tokenize their future income, for example, an artist may swap their future music streaming income for the whole, or a portion, of a collateralized NUSIC synthetic. These can be issued in the form of fractionalized NFT bonds, with future music streaming income assigned directly to the NFT, enabling the capital providers behind the original synthetics to benefit from a share of the future income of the artist.
